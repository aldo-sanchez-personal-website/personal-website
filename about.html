        <h2>Whenever a project or workday is over, I immerse myself in my favorite hobbies.</h2>

        <h3>Gaming!</h3>
        <p>Online gaming is one of the most popular hobbies among young adults and I'm no
            exception! I enjoy spending my downtime after a long day with video games. I like to
            play classic multiplayer games such as Left 4 Dead 2, Team fortress 2, and OldSchool Runescape.
            Games are great way to release stress and I find that it never fails to put me in a good
            mood!

        <h3>Birdwatching!</h3>
        <p>Another hobby I love to do during the spring and summer is going out at dawn to the
            local lakeshore trail to birdwatch. I always found nature to be fascinating and beautiful.
            Gazing at the wildlife and seeing nature at play aalways brings me a sense of peace and
            relaxation, It is a very welcome distraction from the hustle and bustle of city life.
